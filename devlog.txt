In our concept bullet points (page 1), we elaborated on the computer algorithm we plan on implementing for our battleship computer player.
We also elaborate on what we will do to implement short-polling and clarify that the profile page will include both the player's ongoing and finished games.
We decided to take a suggestion that we allow players to use both the mouse pointer and WASD + Enter to make moves.

In our program component bullet points (page 2), we elaborate on how "Pass and Play" battleship will work. We clarify that the two boards on the screen are side by side,
and once again clarify that the user profile includes both the player's ongoing and finished games

Moved the ship date to a later date, since once group suggested we do that.

 - Began boilerplate for the game session and the necessary information
 - Encountered bugs, currently working on a more efficient implementation of the board

wenhaoD -- 2022-03-09 08:34
Started work on a database.py file.
Only simple login and register is set up.
Further testing is needed.

rengZ -- 2022-03-09 08:34
 - Refactored code to more efficient method (some naive solutions there because it would cost more engineering time than it would benefit from)
 - TODO: Test code

rengZ -- 2022-03-10 08:39
 - Refactor tested, works. Created unit test for unit test

wenhaoD -- 2022-03-10 08:36
Added tests for database.py.
Fixed fetch_user and fetch_username not returning a non-tuple value.
Implemented profile_picture column to users table and a set/fetch function for it.

wenhaoD -- 2022-03-11 08:36
Added simple register and login pages that communicates with database.

rengZ -- 2022-03-11 08:37
 -  Working on getting hits online. Creating the infrastructure needed to debug to make sure nothing blows up. Is fun, not implemented yet. Needs a lot more testing.

 - Singleplayer "Pass and Play" basically works (please see battleship.html and /static/js/battleship.js)
 - To Do: Save state of the game into the database on each move
 - To Do: A way to restore the game using the database's data
 - To Do: Add a button underneath each board for hiding the battleship pieces (since both players are using the same screen) and headers that notify players when they have won

wenhaoD 2022-03-14 08:18
 - Finalized login/logout mechanism.

rengZ -- 2022-03-14 08:32
 - Hits working, time to work on sinking. All edge cases seem to be covered (or at least the ones that could be thought up by the brief QA testing phase)

wenhaoD 2022-03-14 08:41
 - Started work on styling.

 haotianG 2022-03-14 8:42
 - Ships now hide in Pass and Play when a player has finished placing their ships
rengZ -- 2022-03-15 08:09
 - Sinks get declared when an attack succeeds in sinking a ship.

rengZ -- 2022-03-15 08:38
 - Got started on random AI.

 haotianG 2022-03-15 9:12
 - Pass and Play bug fixes
 - Working on getting games to save and load from save

rengZ -- 2022-03-16 08:34
 - Implemented a check for game winning
 - Began AI testing with the necessary prequisite function

wenhaoD -- 2022-03-16 08:37
 - Started work on profile pages.

rengZ -- 2022-03-17 08:11
 - Finished random AI checking. Seems to be working

wenhaoD -- 2022-03-17 08:40
 - Tweaked styling and added default prof pic.

rengZ -- 2022-03-17 08:36
 - Did some research on efficient battleship algorithms. Brain funky but I think I understand it.

 haotianG 2022-03-17 12:17
 - Pass and Play bug fixes
 - Pass and Play can now load and save games

wenhaoD -- 2022-03-18 08:31
 - Added ability to change profile pictures
   - not very secure right now because you can change *anyone's* profile picture

rengZ -- 2022-03-18 08:41
 - Commented backend equivalents in the frontend JS
 - Added and tested move history

rengZ -- 2022-03-21 08:52
 - got the website working (mostly) on a droplet
 - modified database file to work on droplet

 haotianG 2022-03-21 23:50
 - Battleship pass and play gui improvements
 - working on saving games to database
 - todo: profile page

wenhaoD 2022-03-22 08:36
 - Profile styling
 - Profiles display name and wins
 - Home page leaderboards fetches from server

rengZ 2022-03-22 08:41
 - Got passnplay up on the server
 - Added login requirement checks to places that need it
 - CSS changes brought in line with everything
 - added 404 errorhandling
