In our concept bullet points (page 1), we elaborated on the computer algorithm we plan on implementing for our battleship computer player.
We also elaborate on what we will do to implement short-polling and clarify that the profile page will include both the player's ongoing and finished games.
We decided to take a suggestion that we allow players to use both the mouse pointer and WASD + Enter to make moves.

In our program component bullet points (page 2), we elaborate on how "Pass and Play" battleship will work. We clarify that the two boards on the screen are side by side,
and once again clarify that the user profile includes both the player's ongoing and finished games

Moved the ship date to a later date, since once group suggested we do that.

 - Began boilerplate for the game session and the necessary information
 - Encountered bugs, currently working on a more efficient implementation of the board

Started work on a database.py file.
Only simple login and register is set up.
Further testing is needed.

 - Refactored code to more efficient method (some naive solutions there because it would cost more engineering time than it would benefit from)
 - TODO: Test code
